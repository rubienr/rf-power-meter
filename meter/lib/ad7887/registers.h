     * Mode 1 - shutdown/full power depending on CS
     * PM1=0 PM0=0
     * In this mode, the AD7887 enters shutdown if the CS input is 1 and is in full power mode
     * when CS is 0. Thus the part comes out of shutdown on the falling edge of CS and enters
     * shutdown on the rising edge of CS.
     *
     * Mode 2 - always on
     * PM1=0 PM0=1
     * In this mode, the AD7887 is always fully powered up, regardless of the status of any of the
     * logic inputs.
     *
     * Mode 3 - auto shutdown
     * PM1=1 PM0=0
     * In this mode, the AD7887 automatically enters shutdown mode at the end of each conversion,
     * regardless of the state of CS.
     *
     * Mode 4 - standby, similar to 3 but faster power up
     * PM1=1 PM0=1
     * In this standby mode, portions of the AD7887 are powered down but the on-chip reference
     * voltage remains powered up. This mode is similar to Mode 3, but allows the part to power up
     * much faster. The REF bit should be 0 to ensure that the on-chip reference is enabled.
